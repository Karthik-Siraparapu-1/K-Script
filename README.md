# K-Script Programming Language (v1.0.0)

**K-Script** is a custom, interpreted programming language designed for minimalism and readability. It features a declarative `Command: Data` syntax, making it a lightweight tool for procedural programming.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Typing:** No need to declare `int` or `string`. The interpreter infers types automatically.
- **Custom Syntax:** Uses a unique `Command: Data` structure (e.g., `print:'Hello'`).
- **Math Engine:** Full support for arithmetic operations respecting **PEMDAS**.
- **Control Flow:** Robust `if` logic and `loop` iteration.
- **Modular Functions:** Define reusable code blocks with `def:` and execute them with `run:`.
- **Pure Python:** Built on a recursive descent interpreter engine with no external dependencies.
